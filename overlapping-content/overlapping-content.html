<!-- This shows how to use grid to setup overlapping content and elminate
the problems that come with position relative and absolute.  
The trick is to setup the grid such that it accomodates both elements
without putting specific sizes on them or the grid.  Instead set max width
or max height on the elements.  See the CSS file for how to set up the grid. -->
